= if Statement

Perl `if` statement allows you to control the execution of your code based on
conditions. The simplest form of the `if` statement is as follows:

[source,perl]
----
if (expression);
----

In this form, you can put the `if` statement after another statement. Letâ€™s
take a look at the following example:

[source,perl]
----
my $a = 1;
print("Welcome to Perl if tutorial\n") if ($a == 1);
----

The message is only displayed if the expression `$a == 1` evaluates to `true`.

.How Perl defines *_true_* and *_false_*?
****
* Both number 0 and string "0" are `false`.
* The `undefined` value is `false`.
* The empty list `()` is `false`.
* The empty string `""` is `false`.
* Everything else is `true`.
****

.Execute multiple statements based on a condition
[source,perl]
----
if (expression) {
   statement;
   statement;
   ...
}
----

[NOTE]
====
The curly braces `{}` are required even if you have a single statement to
execute
====

.*_if..else_* Statement

Perl provides the `if else` statement that allows you to execute a code block
if the expression evaluates to `true`, otherwise, the code block inside the
`else` branch will execute.

[source,perl]
----
if (expression) {
   // if code block;
} else {
   // else code block;
}
----

.Example
[source,perl]
----
my $a = 1;
my $b = 2;
if ($a == $b) {
    print("a and b are equal\n");
} else {
    print("a and b are not equal\n");
}
----

The code block in the else branch will execute because $a and $b are not equal.

.*_if..elsif_* statement

In some cases, you want to test more than one condition:

====
* If `$a` and `$b` are equal, then do this.
* If `$a` is greater than `$b` then do that.
* Otherwise, do something else.
====

Perl provides the if elsif statement for checking multiple conditions and
executing the corresponding code block:

[source,perl]
----
if (expression) {
    ...
} elsif (expression2) {
    ...
} elsif (expression3) {
    ...
} else {
    ...
}
----
