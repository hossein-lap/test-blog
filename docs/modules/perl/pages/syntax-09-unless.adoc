= unless Statement

Before discussing the unless statement, let’s revisit Perl’s philosophy:
____
There is more than one way to do it.
____

Perl always provides you with an alternative way to achieve what you need to do.
In programming, you often hear something like this:

* If it’s not true, then do this (use `if` not statement).
* or unless it’s true, then do this (use `unless` statement).

The effect is the same but the philosophy is different. That’s why Perl
invented the `unless` statement to increase the readability of code when you
use it properly.

[NOTE]
====
the Perl `unless` statement is equivalent to the `if not` statement

.*_unless_* statement
[source,perl]
----
statement unless (condition);
----

Perl executes the statement from right to left, if the condition is `false`,
Perl executes the statement that precedes the `unless`. If the condition is
`true`, Perl skips the statement.

If you have more than one statement to execute, you can use the following form
of the Perl unless statement:
[source,perl]
----
unless (condition) {
    // code block
}
----

If the `condition` evaluates to `false`, Perl executes the code block,
otherwise, it skips the code block.

[source,perl]
----
my $a = 10;

unless($a <= 0){
    print("a is greater than 0\n")	                   
}
----

.*_unless..else_* statement

Sometimes you want to say unless the condition is `true`, then do this,
otherwise do that.

This is where the `unless...else` statement comes into play. See the following
`unless else` statement:

[source,perl]
----
unless (condition) {
    // unless code block
} else {
    // else code block
}
----

If the condition is `false`, Perl will execute the `unless` code block,
otherwise, Perl will execute the `else` code block.

[source,perl]
----
my $a = 10;
unless ($a >= 0) {
    print("a is less than 0\n");                   
} else {
    print("a is greater than or equal 0\n");	                   
}
----
....
a is greater than or equal 0
....

.*_unless..elsif..else_* statement

If you have more than one condition for checking with the `unless` statement,
you can use the `unless elsif else` statement as follows:

[source,perl]
----
unless (condition_1) {
    // unless code block
} elsif (condition_2) {
    // elsif code block
} else {
    // else code block
}
----

You can have many `elsif` clauses in the `unless elsif` statement.

[source,perl]
----
my $a = 1;

unless ($a > 0) {
    print("a is less than 0\n");                   
} elsif ($a == 0) {
    print("a is 0\n");                   
} else {
    print("a is greater than 0\n");	                   
}
----

.*_unless_* statement guidelines
****
====
You should use the `unless` statement with a simple condition to improve the
code readability, especially when used as a postfix after another statement
like the following example:

[source,perl]
----
my $a = 1;
print("unless used with a very simple condition ONLY.\n") unless($a < 0);
----
====

====
You should avoid using the `unless` statement when the condition is complex and
requires `else` and/or `elsif` clauses.

If you take a look at the following code, it is difficult to interpret the
meaning of the condition.

[source,perl]
----
my $a = 1;
my $b = 10;
my $c = 20;
unless ($a < 0 && $b == 10 && $c > 0) {
    print("unless used with a very complex condition\n");
}
