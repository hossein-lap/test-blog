= Perl String

Perl's built-in string functions to manipulate strings.

== Introduction to Perl strings

In Perl, a string is a sequence of characters surrounded by some kind of
quotation marks. A string can contain ASCII, UNICODE, and escape sequences
characters such as `\n`.

A Perl string has a length that depends on the amount of memory in your system,
which is theoretically unlimited.

The following example demonstrates single and double-quoted strings.

[source,perl]
----
my $s1 = "string with doubled-quotes";
my $s2 = 'string with single quote';
----

It is important to remember that the double-quoted string replaces variables
inside it by their values, while the single-quoted string treats them as text.
This is known as variable interpolation in Perl.

== Perl string alternative delimiters

Besides the single and double quotes, Perl also allows you to use quote-like
operators such as:

* The `q//` acts like a single-quoted string.
* The `qq//` acts like double-quoted string

You can choose any non-alphabetic and non-numeric characters as the delimiters,
not only just characters `//`.

[source,perl]
----
#!/usr/bin/perl
use warnings;
use strict;

my $s= q/"Are you learning Perl String today?" We asked./;
print($s ,"\n");

my $name = 'Jack';
my $s2 = qq/"Are you learning Perl String today?"$name asked./;
print($s2 ,"\n");
----

.How it works

* First, defined a single-quoted string variable with the quote-like operator
  `q/`. The string  `$s` ends with `/`
* Second, defined a double-quoted string with the quote-like operator `qq/`. In
  this case, we used the `$name` variable inside a string and it is replaced by
  its value, `Jack`

The following example demonstrates string with the `^` delimiter.

[source,perl]
----
#!/usr/bin/perl
use warnings;
use strict;

my $s = q^A string with different delimiter ^;
print($s,"\n");
----

== Perl string functions

Perl provides a set of functions that allow you to manipulate strings
effectively. We cover the most commonly used string functions in the following
section for your reference.

.Perl string length

To find the number of characters in a string, you use the `length()` function.

[source,perl]
----
my $s = "This is a string\n";
print(length($s),"\n"); #17
----

.Changing cases of string

To change the cases of a string you use a pair of functions `lc()` and `uc()`
that returns the lowercase and uppercase versions of a string.

[source,perl]
----
my $s = "Change cases of a string\n";
print("To upper case:\n");
print(uc($s),"\n");

print("To lower case:\n");
print(lc($s),"\n");
----

.Search for a substring inside a string

To search for a substring inside a string, you use `index()` and `rindex()`
functions.

* The `index()` function searches for a substring inside a string from a
  specified position and returns the position of the first occurrence of the
  substring in the searched string. If the position is omitted, it searches
  from the beginning of the string.
* The `rindex()` function works like the `index()` function except it searches
  from the end of the string instead of from the beginning.

The following example demonstrates how to use the `index()` and `rindex()`
functions:

[source,perl]
----
#!/usr/bin/perl
use warnings;
use strict;

my $s = "Learning Perl is easy\n";
my $sub = "Perl";
my $p = index($s,$sub); # rindex($s,$sub);
print(qq\The substring "$sub" found at position "$p" in string "$s"\,"\n");
----

.Get or modify substring inside a string

To extract a substring out of a string, you use the `substr()` function.

[source,perl]
----
#!/usr/bin/perl
use warnings;
use strict;
# extract substring
my $s = "Green is my favorite color";
my $color  = substr($s, 0, 5);      # Green
my $end    = substr($s, -5);        # color

print($end,":",$color,"\n");

# replace substring
substr($s, 0, 5, "Red"); #Red is my favorite color
print($s,"\n");
----
