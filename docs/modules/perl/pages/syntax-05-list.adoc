= Perl List

Perl list and how to manipulate list elements using various techniques such as
list slicing, ranging and qw() function.

A Perl list is a sequence of
<<doc/02-perl-variables.adoc#_perl_variables,scalar>>
values. You use parenthesis and comma operators to construct a list. Each value
is the list is called list element. List elements are indexed and ordered. You
can refer to each element by its position.

== Simple Perl list

[source,perl]
----
();
(10,20,30);
("this", "is", "a","list");
----

.In the example above:

* The first list `()` is an empty list.
* The second list `(10,20,30)` is a list of integers.
* The third list `("this", "is", "a","list")` is a list of strings.

Each element in the list is separated by a comma `(,)`. The print` operator is
a list operator. So let’s display our lists above with the `print` operator to
see how it works:

[source,perl]
----
#!/usr/bin/perl
use warnings;
use strict;

print(()); # display nothing
print("\n");
print(10,20,30); # display 102030
print("\n");
print("this", "is", "a","list"); # display: thisisalist
print("\n");
----

We passed several lists to the `print` operator to display their elements. All
the lists that we have seen so far contain an element with the same data type.
These lists are called simple lists.

== Complex Perl list

A Perl list may contain elements that have different data types. This kind of
list is called a complex list. Let’s take a look at the following example:

[source,perl]
----
#!/usr/bin/perl
use warnings;
use strict;

my $x = 10;
my $s = "a string";
print("complex list", $x , $s ,"\n");
----

== Using qw function

Perl provides the `qw()` function that allows you to get a list by extracting
words out of a string using the space as a delimiter. The `qw` stands for quote
word. The two lists below are the same:

[source,perl]
----
#!/usr/bin/perl
use warnings;
use strict;

print('red','green','blue'); # redgreenblue
print("\n");

print(qw(red green blue)); # redgreenblue
print("\n");
----

Similar to the `q/` and `q//` operators, you can use any non-alphanumeric
character as a delimiter. The following lists are the same:

[source,perl]
----
qw\this is a list\;
qw{this is a list};
qw[this is a list];
----

== Flattening list

If you put a list, called an internal list, inside another list, Perl
automatically flattens the internal list. The following lists are the same:

[source,perl]
----
(2,3,4,(5,6))
(2,3,4,5,6)
((2,3,4),5,6)
----

== Accessing list element

You can access elements of a list by using the zero-based index. To access the
n^th^ element, you put (n – 1) index inside square brackets.

.Let’s take a look at the following example:
[source,perl]
----
#!/usr/bin/perl
use warnings;
use strict;

print(
     (1,2,3)[0] # 1 first element
);
print "\n"; # new line

print(
     (1,2,3)[2] # 3 third element
);
print "\n"; # new line
----

To get multiple elements of a list at a time, you can put a list inside square
brackets. This feature is called list slice. You can omit the parenthesis of
the list inside the square bracket.

[source,perl]
----
(1,2,3,4,5)[0,2,3] # (1,3,4)
----

The above code returns a list of three elements `(1, 3, 4)`.

== Ranges

Perl allows you to build a list based on a range of numbers or characters e.g.,
a list of numbers from 1 to 100, a list of characters from a to z. The
following example defines two lists:

[source,perl]
----
(1..100)
(a..z)
----
