= while loop statement

Perl `while` loop statement executes a code block repeatedly as long as the
test condition remains `true`. The test condition is checked at the beginning
of each iteration.

[source,perl]
----
while (condition) {
    # code block
}
----

If the `condition` evaluates to `true`, the code block inside `while` loop
executes.

At the beginning of each iteration, the `condition` is reevaluated. The loop is
terminated if the `condition` evaluates to `false`.

At some point in the loop, you have to change some variables that make the
condition `false` to stop the loop. Otherwise, you will have an indefinite loop
that makes your program execute until the stack overflow error occurs.

The `while` loop statement has an optional block: `continue`, which executes
after each current iteration. In practice, the `continue` block is rarely used.

If you want to execute a code block as long as the condition is `false`, you
can use `until` statement.

In case you want to check the condition at the end of each iteration, you use
the `do...while` or `do...until` statement instead.

To control the loop, you use the `next` and `last` statements.

Happy New Year Count Down program

[source,perl]
----
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use warnings;
use strict;

my $counter = 10;

while ($counter > 0) {
    print("$counter\n");
    $counter--; # count down
    sleep(1);   # pause program for 1 second
    if ($counter == 0) {
        print("Happy New Year!\n");
    }
}
----

.Let’s examine the code above in more detail
****
* First, declare a `$counter` variable and set its value to `10`.
* Next, put a condition to make sure that the value of `$counter` is greater
  than zero before entering into the loop.
* Then, displayed the `$counter` and decreased its current value of one. We
  used the `sleep()` function to pause the program for a second in each
  iteration.
* After that, use the _if statement_ to check if `$counter` is zero to print
  the "Happy New Year" message. The code block inside the loop executes 10
  times before the `$counter` is set to zero.
* Finally, after each iteration, the `$counter` decreases, and its value is set
  to zero at the 10th iteration. Perl terminated the loop.

.*_while loop_* with diamond operator *`<>`*

You often use the while loop statement with the diamond operator `<>` to get
the user’s input from the command line:

[source,perl]
----
#!/usr/bin/perl
use warnings;
use strict;

my $num;
my @numbers = ();

print "Enter numbers, each per line :\n";
print "ctrl-z (windows) or ctrl-d(Linux) to exit\n>";

while(my $input = <>) {
    print(">");
    chomp $input;
    $num = int($input);
    push(@numbers, $num);
}

print "You entered: @numbers\n";
----

.How it works

* First, assign the user’s input to the `$input` variable using the diamond
  operator (`<>`). Because it doesn’t specify any filehandle for the diamond
  operator, Perl checks the special array `@ARGV`, which is empty in this case,
  hence instructs the diamond operator to read from `STDIN` i.e., from the
  keyboard.
* Second, remove the newline character from the `$input` variable using the
  `chomp()` function and convert `$input` to an integer.
* Third, add the integer into the `@number` array.

.*_while loop_* statement modifier

let’s take a look at the following example:

[source,perl]
----
#!/usr/bin/perl
use warnings;
use strict;

my $i = 5;
print($i--,"\n") while ($i > 0);
----

The `while` loop statement is placed after another statement.

[NOTE]
====
*Perl evaluates the statements from right to left*.
====

It means that Perl evaluates the condition in the `while` statement at the
beginning of each iteration.

You use the `while` loop statement modifier only if you have one statement to
execute repeatedly based on a condition like the above example.
