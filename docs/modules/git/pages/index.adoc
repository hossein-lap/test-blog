= Git VCS

The most common git commands

== init

This will create a *local* git repository.

[source,bash]
----
git init
----

Also you can git it an *initial branch name*:

[source,bash]
----
git init --initial-branch=trunk
----

== config

You can configure git to behave how you like it to do.

.Some popular options are:
[source,bash]
----
user.name = Your name        # critical
user.email = your@email.com  # critical
core.editor = vim      # default git's text editor
core.autocrlf = input  # for fixing EOL character across multiple OSs
commit.gpgsign = true  # signed commits using GPG
tag.gpgSign = true     #   //   tags     //   // 
merge.ff = true        # fast-forward only when merging/pulling/etc..
init.defaultBranch = master  # default branch for `git init`
color.pager = true           # colored output e.g `git log --oneline`
----

.If you're wondering How to apply these settings on the command line:
[source,bash]
----
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email you@email.com
git config --global merge.ff true
----

== staging area

Middle stage between _Untracked_ files and _Tracked_ files. 

[source,bash]
----
git add .
git add <path/to/file>
----

[NOTE]
====
To see or do anything on files in the staging area (beside committing them),
you need to pass `--cached` argument to the git _subcommand_.

[source,bash]
----
git rm --cached <file-name>
git diff --cached .
----
====

== status

Show the status of files in current repository.

[source,bash]
----
git status
----
....
On branch notes/git
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   git.adoc

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.session.vim/
	asciidoctor-theme.yml
	git.pdf

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
....

.Short version:
[source,bash]
----
git status -s
----
....
 M git.adoc
?? .session.vim/
?? asciidoctor-theme.yml
?? git.pdf
....

[NOTE]
====
* `??`: Untracked files
* `M` : Modified tracked files
* `A` : Files in staging area but not committed
* `UU`: Files having _conflicts_ which needs extra manual/automated work
====

.If you want to see the status from the current working directory:
[source,bash]
----
git status -s .
----
....
 M git.adoc
?? .session.vim/
?? asciidoctor-theme.yml
?? git.pdf
....

== commit

Look at *commit* as adding changes to the _git history_.

[source,bash]
----
git commit
----

The command above will open the _git's text editor_ for you to write a _commit
message_ for the changes you've made. To avoid that you can give the message
at the command line:

[source,bash]
----
git commit -m 'my very obvious commit message'
----

.Some extra flags for commit:
[source,bash]
----
--no-gpg-sign  # don't sign the commit, just for this one
--amend        # apply changes to the last commit, no new commit
               # Warning: be careful with this, it can mess things up
--no-edit      # used with `--amend`, don't change commit message
----

=== authenticate

For committing you need to be authenticated. You can this in a global scope
(which is recommended for most users) or do it in a per-repo basis:

.Global
[source,bash]
----
git config --global user.name 'You Name'
git config --global user.email 'you@email.com'
----

.Per Repository, inside the local repository
[source,bash]
----
git config user.name 'You Name'
git config user.email 'you@email.com'
----

[NOTE]
====
Keep that in mind for working with services like *github.com* and *gitlab.com*,
the email you provide to the git, must be the same email as the one which you
gave these services.
====

== log

Shows information about the current repository such as *branches*, *commits*,
HEAD position, etc.

[source,bash]
----
git log

....

.What is *HEAD*?

*HEAD* is a name which points to your *current working area*'s position in the
git repository. In the above output, inside the parentheses on the second line
you can see `HEAD \-> notes/git`, that mean *HEAD is pointing at notes/git
branch*. `notes/git` is the name of the branch that I'm writing this document
inside of it that will be merged later with `master` branch of this repository.

Now that we know HEAD is the current position, let's be a little more proactive
shall we? Okay, what about pointing at *one previous position* or
*two previous*? Easy, `HEAD~1` and `HEAD~2` are for that.

[TIP]
====
`HEAD~<number>` means `<number>` times before the *current position of HEAD*.
====

== remotes

The remote URL(s) that you are/will be working with. Most of the time it's
called *origin* but remember, it's just a name which points to an URL.

[source,bash]
----
git remote
----
....
origin
....

.Verbose output
[source,bash]
----
git remote -v
----
....
origin	git@github.com:hossein-lap/blog.posts.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:hossein-lap/blog.posts.git (push)
....

.Working with remotes
[source,bash]
----
git remote add <name> <url>  # add new remote URL
git remote remove <name>     # remove existing remote URL
----

. remote URL can be another directory/folder on the same machine. git does
  not care.
. If you want to connect a local repository to a remote one, you need to create
  the remote yourself

[NOTE]
====
Let's say you are working on a project on your local machine and now you've
decided to share it on github, you go create the repository on github, and
create a remote using `git remote add <name> <url>` command.
====

=== ssh vs https

Most developers prefer using `ssh` when it comes to working with remote
repositories. `ssh` has a SHA-256 hash-based key authentication method.
Unlike `https` which requires username and password each time for the
authentication.

.Generate ssh key
[source,bash]
----
ssh-keygen
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
After creating a ssh key-pair, you need to add the *public* pair of the key to
your github/gitlab account. Look for a `*.pub` file in your `~/.ssh` directory.
====

.ssh remote URL:
....
origin	git@github.com:hossein-lap/blog.posts.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:hossein-lap/blog.posts.git (push)
....

.https remote URL:
....
origin	https://github.com/hossein-lap/blog.posts (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/hossein-lap/blog.posts (push)
....

== clone

Cloning a repository is like downloading it from your local machine but with or
without the commit histories.

[source,bash]
----
git clone <url>
git clone https://github.com/hossein-lap/blog.posts
git clone git@github.com:hossein-lap/blog.posts.git
----

.Some extra flags
[source,bash]
----
--depth <number>   # depths of previous commit history
--branch <name>    # move HEAD to the <name> branch after clone
--origin <name>    # use <name> instead of default `origin` for remote
--bare             # clone the bare repo (useful but very advanced)
                   # see the last section for more information.
----

== fetch

Synchronize the local repository with the remote repository. This does not change
anything in the current working area. Just synchronizing.

[source,bash]
----
git fetch --all        # fetch all changes from all branches
git fetch --unshallow  # fetch all the missing contents from remote
----

== push

Upload the git history from local to the remote.

[source,bash]
----
git push <remote-name> <branch-name>
----

[source,bash]
----
git push origin master
----

.Forced push
[CAUTION]
====
You need to use `--force` flag if you want to have used `--amend` flag
(you've amended a commit) when pushing to a *unprotected* remote branch.

[source,bash]
----
git commit --amend --no-edit
git push origin feature/new-module --force
----
.Use this with caution
If the branch if *protected* you cannot use `--force` with.
You must remove it from *protected branches* first.
====

== pull

Get the changes from remote repository to the local repository.

[source,bash]
----
git pull origin master
----

[CAUTION]
====
Be careful what branch are you currently on and what branch are you pulling
from. This can mess things up very easily.
====

== branch

Working with branches.
Branches are created from one point in the history which is you current branch

.Your current branch
[source,bash]
----
git branch
----
....
* notes/git
....

.Create new branch
[source,bash]
----
git switch -C <new-branch-name>
----

Above command will create a new branch from your current position on the git
history (your current branch, your current commit) and switch to it.


Alternatively you can use `checkout` (sometimes you *need* to use `checkout`) but
the `checkout` command does a lot more than creating/switching branches.
*It can be dangerous*.

[source,bash]
----
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
----

.Switch back to previous branch
[source,bash]
----
git checkout -
git switch -
----

== stash

To be able to change branches your current working area must be clean. Now imagine
you're middle of working on something and something new comes up which is
important, git won't allow you to change your branch until you commit your
changes (make your working area clean) so what you're gonna do? Apply a temp
commit? (you can do that on paper but it's advised against doing this). Here
`stash` comes to save the day.

`git stash` takes all your changes (on tracked files only) and temporarily
moves them on *stash area* so you can access it (move it back to your working
area) after you've did you explorations.

Let's see how `git log` looks like before stashing the changes:

.Move changes to stash from working area
[source,bash]
----
git log --oneline --all --graph
----
....
* afd0009 Add array section
* f80c365 more / better notes for docker
* 6e057f8 import contents
* a9555db Initial commit
....

.Stashing changes
[source,bash]
----
git stash push
----
....
Saved working directory and index state WIP on notes/git: f80c365 more / better notes for docker
....

Let's see how `git log` looks like at this point
[source,bash]
----
git log --oneline --all --graph
----
....
*   aa604f7 WIP on notes/git: f80c365 more / better notes for docker
|\  
| * 977460d index on notes/git: f80c365 more / better notes for docker
|/  
| * afd0009 Add array section
|/  
* f80c365 more / better notes for docker
* 6e057f8 import contents
* a9555db Initial commit
....

See all the new forks and diversions from the commits?

....
*   aa604f7 WIP on notes/git: f80c365 more / better notes for docker
|\  
| * 977460d index on notes/git: f80c365 more / better notes for docker
|/  
| * afd0009 Add array section
|/  
* f80c365 more / better notes for docker
....

.Move back changes to working area from stash
[source,bash]
----
git stash pop
----
....
On branch notes/git
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   git.adoc

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .session.vim/
        asciidoctor-theme.yml
        git.pdf
        git.xml

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
Dropped refs/stash@{0} (a5eec65b3011ad09cd73c9845646ea1b87659f9e)
....

Now everything is exactly how it was before stashing:
[source,bash]
----
git log --oneline --all --graph
----
....
* afd0009 Add array section
* f80c365 more / better notes for docker
* 6e057f8 import contents
* a9555db Initial commit
....

[TIP]
====
stash has a stack-like structure.
====

[NOTE]
====
Alternatively you can use a `bare repo` with git's `worktree` feature which
allows you to have multiple branches checked-out at the same time. But it can
add complexity to your workflow. You can take a look at the last section of
this
document.
====

== rebase

Rebasing a branch is pulling the point branch was forked (created from) to a
new point.

.git's manpage does a good explanation about it:
....
Assume the following history exists and the current branch is "topic":

              A---B---C topic
             /
        D---E---F---G master

From this point, the result of either of the following commands:

    git rebase master
    git rebase master topic

would be:

                      A'--B'--C' topic
                     /
        D---E---F---G master
....

[IMPORTANT]
====
All the git manpages are available through either `git <subcommand> --help`
command or `man git-<subcommand>` command on the command line.

----
git rebase --help
man git-rebase
----
====

== restore

Restores the state of file(s) to a previous or current state in git *history*.

[CAUTION]
====
[source,bash]
----
git restore --source=HEAD .
----
====

The above command will remove all changes on the current working directory
which are not in neither staging area nor have been committed.

The `.` means *current working directory*. You can replace it with file name(s)
or (some) directory.

== reset

Okay, now we are entering the *DANGER* zone. The reset command *will remove
your commit history*. Especially with the `--hard` flag.

[WARNING]
====
[source,bash]
----
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git reset --hard 6e057f8 # reset everything to a certain point
                         # using commit hash
----
====

== patching

You can get a diff file using `git diff` command and use it later.
These "diff" files contains all changes on file(s) which can be applied on same
files somewhere else.

.Get diff file
[source,bash]
----
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD > <file-name>
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD > test-changes.diff
----

.Apply the diff
[source,bash]
----
patch -p1 < <file-name>
patch -p1 < test-changes.diff
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Keep that in mind which the sequence of stages/commits must be *older to newer*
if you want to *apply* the changes and *newer to older* if you want to *revert*
the changes.
Reverts

[horizontal]
* *Older to newer*: Applies changes
* *Newer to older*: Reverts changes
====

[NOTE]
====
This process is called *patching* or *applying patch*.
====

[TIP]
====
When you are applying patch(es), you must be at the *exact directory* that
you've get the diff file from.

On the other words, applying patches only works when
you are applying them at the same *root directory* of getting the patch (diff
file).
